# W.A.F-A-Plague-Tale
This Python script rebuilds your dialogue WEM files so that the "A Plague Tale" games can read them correctly with working lipsync animations.

How to Use
. Step 1: Unpack the .7z file into any folder you like.

. Step 2: Open the Python script using IDLE or PowerShell (IDLE is recommended).

. Step 3: Scroll to the bottom of the script. You'll find three folder paths — replace them with the paths to the folders included in the .7z file.

. Step 4: Use [mrikso]’s tool to extract the .wem files from the .pck.

. Step 5: Create your edited .wem files, using the exact same names as the original files you want to replace.

. Step 6: Place your edited files in the Mod folder.

. Step 7: Put the original (vanilla) files in the Original folder.

. Step 8: Run the script (press F5). The resulting .wem files will be saved in the Output folder.
